# Chatty Group Project
Your group will be creating a chat application. The features your team will build have already been added to your backlog. This application should demonstrate your skills in:
- Modular code
- Dependency chaining
- Asynchronous code
- DOM interaction
- Debugging

## Requirements
* Use Bootstrap
* Balanced GitHub contributions
* Completed README
* No Grunt errors
* Use Browserify

## Interacting With Your Product Owner
Your group has been designated a product owner (one of the instructors). This product owner has the overall vision of the application and must approve your tickets before you start working on them. When you complete the MVP tickets in your backlog, you should reach out to your product owner to recieve tickets for additional features. Note that this project is often used as a portfolio project for students, so you and your team should push yourselves to get to the "game changer" bonus features, but only after you have a strong MVP.


Check out the [simple wireframe](https://app.moqups.com/chortlehoort/uGBbLbK46Y/view/page/a3bd0c733) for this application on Moqups.com. You can make your final interface as fancy as you like, but keep the general layout similar to the wireframe.
